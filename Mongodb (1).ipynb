    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "Ans. MongoDB is a popular open-source, document-oriented NoSQL database management system. It stores data in flexible, semi-structured documents using a format called BSON (Binary JSON). Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB falls under the category of non-relational databases or NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data and offer more flexibility in data storage and retrieval compared to traditional SQL (relational) databases. They are well-suited for scenarios where data models may evolve rapidly, and where high scalability and performance are important. Non-relational databases often provide horizontal scaling, meaning they can handle large amounts of data and traffic by distributing the load across multiple servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Flexible and Evolving Schema**: MongoDB allows you to store data with varying structures within the same database collection. This flexibility is beneficial when dealing with changing or evolving data requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Semi-Structured Data**: If your data is not neatly structured into tables and rows, but rather consists of nested documents, arrays, and key-value pairs, MongoDB's document-oriented approach is more natural to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scalability**: MongoDB's architecture makes it easier to scale out horizontally by adding more servers to handle increased traffic and data volume. This can be advantageous for applications that expect rapid growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Speed and Performance**: MongoDB's design, especially for read-heavy workloads, can offer better performance due to its ability to store related data together in a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Agile Development**: MongoDB's schema-less nature is well-suited for agile development environments where requirements are likely to change during the development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Real-time Analytics**: For applications requiring real-time analytics or dealing with large amounts of rapidly changing data (like sensor data or social media feeds), MongoDB's dynamic schema and fast writes can be advantageous.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's important to note that the choice between MongoDB and SQL databases should be based on your specific use case and requirements. SQL databases excel in scenarios where data relationships are complex and require ACID transactions, and where data integrity and consistency are paramount.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, MongoDB is a non-relational database that shines in scenarios requiring flexibility, scalability, performance, and where the data model is dynamic and constantly evolving."

    "Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "Ans . MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database management system that offers a range of features designed to address the needs of modern applications and data management. Here are some key features of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Document-Oriented Storage: MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents called BSON (Binary JSON), which allows for easy representation of complex data structures, nested arrays, and key-value pairs. This document-oriented approach is well-suited for handling semi-structured and diverse data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Dynamic Schema: MongoDB's schema is dynamic, meaning each document in a collection can have different fields and structures. This provides flexibility, allowing you to change the schema without the need for migrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. NoSQL Model: MongoDB is a NoSQL database, which means it does not adhere to the rigid tabular structure of traditional SQL databases. It can handle a wide variety of data types and relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Horizontal Scalability: MongoDB supports horizontal scaling, allowing you to distribute data and traffic across multiple servers or nodes. This helps handle large amounts of data and high traffic loads by adding more servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. High Availability: MongoDB offers features like replica sets, which provide automatic failover and data redundancy. Replica sets ensure that your data remains available even in the event of hardware failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Automatic Sharding: Sharding is the process of distributing data across multiple servers. MongoDB can automatically shard data, enabling it to scale out and handle increasing data volumes and workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Query Language and Indexing: MongoDB provides a powerful query language that supports various operations, including filtering, sorting, and aggregation. It also supports indexing for efficient data retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Aggregation Framework: MongoDB's aggregation framework allows you to perform complex data transformations, filtering, grouping, and computation operations directly within the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Geospatial Indexes and Queries: MongoDB has built-in support for geospatial data, enabling the storage and efficient querying of location-based information.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Full-Text Search: MongoDB provides full-text search capabilities, allowing you to perform text-based searches across your documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Ad Hoc Queries:MongoDB supports ad hoc queries, enabling developers to quickly and flexibly retrieve and analyze data without the need to predefine complex joins or schemas.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Flexible Deployment Options:MongoDB can be deployed on-premises or in the cloud, and it supports various operating systems and platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Community and Enterprise Editions: MongoDB offers both a free community edition with open-source features and a paid enterprise edition with additional features, support, and security options.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. Rich Ecosystem: MongoDB has a vibrant and active community, extensive documentation, libraries for various programming languages, and tools for monitoring, management, and data visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "These features make MongoDB a versatile and powerful choice for a wide range of use cases, especially those involving large amounts of diverse and rapidly changing data, as well as applications that require scalability and high availability."

    "Q7. Explain why delete_one(), delete_many(), and drop() is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.`delete_one()`, `delete_many()`, and `drop()` are methods provided by MongoDB to manage and remove data from a collection or an entire database. Each of these methods serves a specific purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`delete_one()` Method:**\n",
    "   The `delete_one()` method is used to remove a single document from a collection that matches a specified filter/query. If there are multiple documents that match the filter, only the first matching document will be deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Syntax:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   result = collection.delete_one(filter)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   result = mycollection.delete_one({\"name\": \"Alice\"})\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This code will delete the first document with the name \"Alice\" from the collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`delete_many()` Method:**\n",
    "   The `delete_many()` method is used to remove multiple documents from a collection that match a specified filter/query. It can delete all documents that meet the specified criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Syntax:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   result = collection.delete_many(filter)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   result = mycollection.delete_many({\"age\": {\"$gte\": 30}})\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This code will delete all documents with an age greater than or equal to 30 from the collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`drop()` Method:**\n",
    "   The `drop()` method is used to completely remove a collection from the database. This operation also removes all the documents within the collection, effectively deleting the entire collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Syntax:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   collection.drop()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   mycollection.drop()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This code will drop (delete) the entire \"mycollection\" from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Cases:\n",
    "- `delete_one()` can be useful when you want to remove a specific record from a collection, such as deleting a user profile.\n",
    "- `delete_many()` is handy when you need to remove multiple records based on a specific condition, like removing outdated data or cleaning up a log.\n",
    "- `drop()` is used to delete an entire collection when you no longer need it or want to start fresh, but use it with caution as it irreversibly removes the collection and all its data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that these operations are irreversible, so use them carefully, especially when dealing with production data. Always make sure to have proper backups and confirm your intentions before executing any deletion or dropping operations."
